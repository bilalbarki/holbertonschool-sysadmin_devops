1. What should you create? Using what?
An RSA key-pair should be created (for SSH authentication) which includes a public and a private key. To create a 4096 bits RSA key-pair, the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 should be used. ssh-keygen is used to generate authentication key, -t option is used for the type of key and -b is used for mentioning the bits. When you generate your keypair, you'll be asked for a passphrase, type it. For the key-pair you can either choose the default directory or a custom one.

2. What should you do with the public key? How will it be used? What will it do?
As the name suggests the public key is for distribution, any system which wants to authenticate with you securely when you ssh into it should get this public key and it should append this key to its  ~.ssh/authorized_keys. Now whenever you ssh into it, that system will be able to authenticate with you using your public key. The public key can only encrypt data and CANNOT decrypt it. Only the system which has the private key for it can ever decrypt the data encrypted using your public key.

3. What should you do with the private key? How will it be used? What will it do?
The private key should be kept securely hidden, away from any prying eyes; only for your use. The private key will be used for authentication with the server you are connecting to. The authentication message will be encrypted by your public key which only can be decrypted by your private key.
